This project analyzes sentiment trajectories across many books using the Bing sentiment lexicon and the Jane Austen corpus. The analysis is then expanded to include a bespoke corpus of headlines in the style of the New York Times, utilizing both the AFINN and Bing lexicons. The libraries tidytext, dplyr, and ggplot2 are used to implement the analysis, and R Markdown is used to create the visualizations. The versatility of tidytext in managing various text datasets and sentiment lexicons is demonstrated in this study.
